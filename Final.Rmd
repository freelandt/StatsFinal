##Introduction

Data was assembled from over 16,000 video games that were sold between 1985 and 2016. Using the sales information and review scores of the video games we set out to examine what factors had different effects on European sales compared to North American sales. Exploratory studies in the past have looked at how different genres of video games sell better in different parts of the world. 

##Methods

Our data was compiled by two users on the website Kaggle.com. This dataset contains data for over 16,500 videos games, including title, year of release, units sold in US/Europe/Asia/Worldwide, user and critic review scores, genre, publisher, developer, and ESRB rating (suggested age to play). The user and critic review scores were obtained through popular video game review website Metacritit.com. 

Two of our factor variables, Publisher and Developer, had over 500 different levels so we need to condense the levels for our models to converge properly. Also the two factors were highly correlated and the Publisher variable was more salient so we only used the Publisher variable for our models. For the Publisher variable we decided to group together any publisher that didn't appear in more than 10 observations in our data set into an "Other" category. This meant we condensed our publishers from 582 unique instances down to 53 unique publishers and an other category. After condesing the different levels publishers down we no longer had convergence issues in our models of EU and NA sales. 

All of our sales variables began as counts in millions of units. However, since our data contained decimal places we needed to transform the variablesin order to use the Poisson and Negative Binomial models. For our modeleling we multiplied our sales variables by 100 so that the number of units sold were in counts of 10,000s as whole numbers as opposed to decimals in the millions of units sold.

Originally our critic ratings variable was on a scale from 0-100 and our user ratings variable was on a scale from 0.0-10.0. For our modeling we wanted the two rating variables to be on the same scale and so we divided the critic ratings by 10 in order to put the critic ratings on a scale from 0.0-10.0 as well. 

Each individual observation in our data set is of a game being released on a certain platform. This means that for games that were released on multiple platforms, there is an observation for each platform that the game was released on. For our analysis we only used observations that were complete, which meant we had 6,894 observations left in our dataset to use. 

For a full overview of each individual variable in our data set, see description below:

Name = Name of the game  
Platform = Console on which the game is running  (31 different consoles)  
Year2 = Year that the game was released (Year2 = 0 for the year 1985)   
Genre = Game's category (Ex: Sports, Racing, Puzzle...)  (13 different levels)  
Publisher = Publisher of the Game  (582 unique publishers)  
Publisher2 = Publisher of the Game (53 Publishers and an Other category)  
NA_Sales = Game sales in North America (in millions of units)  
EU_Sales = Game sales in the European Union (in millions of units)  
JP_Sales = Game sales in Japan (in millions of units)  
Other_Sales = Game sales in the rest of the world, i.e. Africa, Asia exlcuding Japan, Australia, Europe exluding the E.U. and South America (in millions of units)  
Global_Sales = Total sales in the world (in millions of units)  
Critic_Score = Aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff (rating between 0-100)  
Critic_Score2 = Critic_Score / 10 to be on the same scale as the User_Score (rating between 0.0-10.0)  
Critic_Count = The number of critics scores used in formulating the overall Critic_Score  
User_Score = Score by Metacritic's subscribers  (rating between 0.0-10.0)  
User_Count = Number of users who gave the User_Score  
Developer = Party responsible for creating the game  (1697 unique Developers)  
Rating = The ESRB ratings (E.g. Teen, Adults Only, Everyone..) (9 levels)  
Rating2 = ESRB ratings combining barely used ratings into a "No Rating" level (5 levels)

##Results

Summary statistics for sales figures in North America and Europe, as well as user score, critic score, and year of release are given in Table 1. Exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate whether game platform and publisher should be fixed or random effects in our model. These plots are given in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, we can see that although some platforms have several outliers that achieved high sales, most platforms have similar sales distributions. This would suggest that a random effect may not be appropriate here. The case is similar in Figure 1b. Here we have similar distributions is sales for all publishers, suggesting a fixed effect may be sufficient in our models. It shouls be noted that all publishers will be included during the modeling process, but for clarity in this graph, only the data for 10 are provided.
